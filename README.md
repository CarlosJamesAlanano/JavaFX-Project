message by the leader,

this is a school project where me and my team(me) created a kinda uber clone called 'chauffeur'. 
i made this in javafx so our work is pretty much very different from the rest of the groups because they used JFrames for their projects.

project made by: Group 8, consisting of the leader Carlos James Alanano, and members, Heart De Villa and Althea Bautista.
defended on the 20th of june, 2024.
